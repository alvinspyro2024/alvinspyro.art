    📖 <h1><strong>John 3:16 (NASB)</strong></h1>
    <p><em>“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.”</em></p>
  </div>

      <h2>🕵️ 1. Observation: What does the verse say?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"For God so loved the world" – God's immense love for all humanity.</li>
      <li>"That He gave His only Son" – The sacrificial giving of Jesus.</li>
      <li>"So that everyone who believes in Him" – The invitation is open to all who believe.</li>
      <li>"Will not perish" – A promise of salvation from eternal separation.</li>
      <li>"But have eternal life" – The gift of everlasting life with God.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This verse encapsulates the essence of the Gospel message.</p>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>💡 Why God Gave His Son (and Man’s Sinfulness)</h2>
    <p>All people are born into sin, and we are utterly lost without hope. The Bible says, "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). Our sin separates us from a holy God. We cannot save ourselves. Our efforts are not enough. We deserve death (Romans 6:23).</p>
    <p>Man cannot pay for his sin. No amount of good works, no amount of effort, can make us right with God. Our sin is too great, and the cost is too high. We stand guilty, condemned, and unable to save ourselves. There is no way for us to bridge the gap between us and the holy God we have offended.</p>
    <p>But God, in His infinite mercy and love, provided a way for us to be saved—through the sacrifice of His Son. Jesus, the unblemished Lamb of God, was sent to take on the punishment we deserved. "He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him" (Isaiah 53:5–6). Jesus lived a sinless life and, though He had no sin of His own, He took on our sin and bore the weight of it on the cross.</p>
    <p>He died the sinner's death—our death—so that through His sacrifice, we could be forgiven and reconciled to God. The penalty for sin was paid by the only one who could bear it: the spotless Lamb, Jesus Christ. There is no other way. Only through Him, the perfect sacrifice, can we be made right with God. Jesus is the only way, the only truth, and the only life (John 14:6).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>💡 2. Historical Setting: What was happening and who was Jesus speaking to?</h2>
    <p>Jesus was speaking to Nicodemus, a respected Jewish religious leader. He came to Jesus at night, seeking truth. This conversation, found in John 3, happened early in Jesus’ ministry. Jesus told him the need to be “born again,” and shared the amazing truth of God's love.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>💡 3. Interpretation: What does the verse mean?</h2>
    <ol>
      <p><strong>1. “For God so loved the world”</strong> This phrase shows the motivation behind God’s action: His love.</p>
      <li>The word <strong>“so”</strong> doesn’t only mean “very much.” It also means “in this way”.</li>
      <li>God’s love isn’t just a feeling—it’s an active, giving, <strong>sacrificial love.</strong></li>
      <li>“The world” refers to all of humanity, including Jews and Gentiles, sinners, and enemies of God.</li>
      <li>This love is <strong>undeserved.</strong> The world did not love God, yet He loved us first.</li>
   
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🧰 4. Application: How should I respond?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Examine your heart—do you truly believe in Jesus?</li>
      <li>If you already believe, rest in His love and security.</li>
      <li>If you haven’t yet, see this as God’s invitation for you today.</li>
      <li>Share this Good News with someone who needs hope.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  
    <h3>🙏 Short Prayer</h3>
    <p>Lord God,</p>
    <p>I stand before You, fully aware of my sin and my inability to save myself. My heart is heavy with guilt, and my spirit is broken. I am lost, hopeless, and cannot escape the path I am on. I cannot undo the wrongs I’ve done. My sin has separated me from You, and I know that if I were to die in this state, I deserve nothing but eternal separation from Your presence.</p>
<p>I come to You, not because I deserve it, but because I have no other hope. I confess that I have sinned against You, and I repent from my heart, knowing that my sin has condemned me. I ask that You have mercy on me, a sinner, and I beg You to save me from the consequences of my rebellion.</p>
<p>I do not come with any claim to righteousness, for I have none. I cannot offer You anything to earn Your forgiveness. I come only with the desperate plea that You, in Your grace, would turn my heart and lead me to repentance that I may know Your truth.</p>
<p>Please reveal to me, Lord, the depth of Your love and mercy. I believe in Jesus Christ—Your Son—who died for my sins and rose again to offer me new life. I ask You to grant me the gift of salvation, not because I deserve it, but because You are merciful and just.</p>
<p>Please, Lord, save me. Pull me out of this darkness, and let Your Holy Spirit transform my heart. Guide me to follow You, to live according to Your will, and to never turn back. May my life be a testimony of Your grace and mercy.</p>
<p>In Jesus' name,</p>
 <p>Amen.
