  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">üí° 2. Historical Setting: What was happening and who was Jesus speaking to?</h3>
    <p>Jesus spoke these words to Nicodemus, a respected Jewish religious leader and member of the Sanhedrin. Nicodemus approached Jesus at night, seeking understanding. This conversation occurred early in Jesus' ministry and is recorded in John 3. Jesus explained the necessity of being "born again" to see the kingdom of God, leading to this profound declaration of God's love and the path to eternal life.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">üí° 3. Interpretation: What does the verse mean?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>God is the initiator of salvation, reaching out to humanity in love.</li>
      <li>Love is demonstrated through action; God gave His most precious gift‚ÄîHis only Son.</li>
      <li>Jesus' mission was to die as a substitute for sinners, offering salvation to those who believe.</li>
      <li>Belief entails trusting Jesus wholly, not merely acknowledging facts.</li>
      <li>Eternal life begins now with a restored relationship with God and continues after death.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This verse teaches that salvation is by grace through faith, highlighting the depth of God's love and the necessity of personal belief in Jesus.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">üß∞ 4. Application: How should I respond?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reflect on whether you truly believe in Jesus with both heart and mind.</li>
      <li>If you're already a believer, find assurance in the security and love you have in Christ.</li>
      <li>If you haven't trusted Jesus yet, consider this verse as God's personal invitation to you.</li>
      <li>Share this message of love and salvation with others who need to hear it.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">üôè Short Prayer</h3>
    <p>
      Lord God,<br>
      I come before You knowing that I am a sinner‚Äîguilty, broken, and unable to save myself. I repent of my sins and turn away from them, surrendering fully to You. Thank You for loving the world so deeply that You gave Your only Son. I believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay the penalty for my sins and rose again to give me new life.<br><br>
      I confess Jesus as my only Savior and submit to Him as my Lord. I trust in Him alone for my salvation‚Äînot my works, not my goodness, but only His finished work on the cross. Please forgive me, change my heart, and fill me with Your Spirit. Help me tochange my heart, and fill me with Your Spirit. Help me to follow You all the days of my life.
      <br><br>
      In Jesus' name, Amen.
    </p>
