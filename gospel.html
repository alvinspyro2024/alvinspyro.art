  <h1>The Gospel Message</h1>

  <p><strong>John MacArthur</strong>, a well-known pastor and Bible teacher, emphasizes a clear, biblical, and direct presentation of the gospel. While he doesn’t use a rigid step-by-step formula like some evangelistic programs, he has described his one-on-one evangelism approach as:</p>

  <h2>1. Starting with God's Holiness and the Law</h2>
  <p>MacArthur typically begins by establishing God’s holiness and the sinfulness of man, helping the person understand that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). He often uses the Ten Commandments to reveal personal guilt and the need for a Savior.</p>

  <h2>2. Presenting the Person and Work of Christ</h2>
  <p>He then shares who Jesus is—fully God and fully man—and what He accomplished:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lived a sinless life</li>
    <li>Died on the cross as a substitute for sinners</li>
    <li>Rose again on the third day</li>
  </ul>
  <p>He emphasizes penal substitution—that Christ bore the wrath of God in the sinner's place (Isaiah 53:5–6, 2 Corinthians 5:21).</p>

  <h2>3. Calling for Repentance and Faith</h2>
  <p>MacArthur stresses the biblical command to repent and believe (Mark 1:15). He doesn’t promote “easy-believism” or quick decisions; rather, he calls for genuine repentance, surrender to Christ’s lordship, and saving faith.</p>

  <h2>4. Avoiding Manipulation</h2>
  <p>He does not usually lead people in a sinner’s prayer. Instead, he encourages them to cry out to God from the heart. MacArthur believes salvation is a work of God, not something that comes through a scripted prayer or emotional pressure.</p>

  <h2>5. Pointing Them to Scripture and Ongoing Discipleship</h2>
  <p>He typically urges people to read the Bible (often starting in the Gospel of John or Romans), to seek truth, and to get connected with a sound, Bible-teaching church.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Simplified Version of MacArthur’s Gospel Sharing Approach</h2>
  <p>Start with God's Holiness:</p>
  <blockquote>“God is perfectly holy and just. He created us to know Him and live for Him.”</blockquote>
  <p>Explain Man’s Sinfulness:</p>
  <blockquote>“But every one of us has sinned—lied, lusted, been proud or angry—and broken His law.”</blockquote>
  <p>Describe the Consequence:</p>
  <blockquote>“Because God is just, sin must be punished. That’s eternal separation from Him—hell.”</blockquote>
  <p>Present Christ’s Saving Work:</p>
  <blockquote>“But God, in love, sent His Son, Jesus Christ—fully God and fully man—to live a perfect life and take the punishment we deserve by dying on the cross.”</blockquote>
  <p>Call for Repentance and Faith:</p>
  <blockquote>“He rose from the dead. And now, God commands all people to repent—turn from sin—and trust in Jesus alone to be forgiven and saved.”</blockquote>
  <p>Encourage a Heart Response:</p>
  <blockquote>“This isn’t about joining a religion or saying a prayer—it’s about surrendering your life to Jesus as Lord and Savior, believing in Him from your heart.”</blockquote>

  <h2>Narrative: Sharing the Gospel One-on-One</h2>
  <p><em>Setting: On a flight from Los Angeles to Dallas. He’s seated next to a businessman named Mike.</em></p>
  <p><strong>MacArthur:</strong> “Mike, can I ask you something? It might sound deep, but I often ask people this—what do you think happens after we die?”</p>
  <p><strong>Mike:</strong> “Hmm. I think we just go to a better place… hopefully.”</p>
  <p><strong>MacArthur:</strong> “That's what most people hope. But what if I told you God has actually told us what happens—and it’s more serious than most people think?”</p>
  <p><strong>Mike:</strong> “You mean like heaven and hell?”</p>
  <p><strong>MacArthur:</strong> “Exactly. God is holy—completely pure and just. And He created us to live for Him. But we’ve all sinned—lied, lusted, gotten angry unjustly. And God, being just, must judge sin.”</p>
  <p><strong>Mike:</strong> “I've messed up.”</p>
  <p><strong>MacArthur:</strong> “We all have. But here’s the good news—God sent His Son, Jesus, to take our punishment. Jesus lived a perfect life, then died on the cross in the place of sinners. He rose from the dead, proving who He is."</p>
  <p><strong>Mike:</strong> “So what does that mean for me?”</p>
  <p><strong>MacArthur:</strong> “God calls you to repent—to turn from sin—and believe in Jesus. Not just believe facts, but entrust your whole life to Him as Savior and Lord. He forgives everyone who truly comes to Him.”</p>
  <p><strong>Mike:</strong> “Is there a prayer I need to say?”</p>
  <p><strong>MacArthur:</strong> You don’t need a script. Just talk to God honestly. A broken heart that turns to Him in faith is what He wants. If God is working in your heart, don’t delay—cry out to Him. And start reading His Word.”</p>
  <p><strong>Mike:</strong> “Thanks. That’s a lot to think about.”</p>
  <p><strong>MacArthur:</strong> “I’ll pray for you. And here—let me point you to the Gospel of John. It’s a good place to start.”</p>

  <h2>Memorizable Outline (G.R.A.C.E.D.)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>G – God is holy.</strong> “God created us to know Him and live for Him. He is perfectly holy and just.”</li>
    <li><strong>R – Rebellion is our problem.</strong> “But we’ve all sinned—disobeyed God in thoughts, words, and actions.”</li>
    <li><strong>A – Accountability is real.</strong> “Because God is just, He will punish sin. The Bible says the wages of sin is death—eternal separation from Him.”</li>
    <li><strong>C – Christ is the solution.</strong> “God sent Jesus—fully God and fully man—to live a perfect life and die on the cross to take the punishment we deserve.”</li>
    <li><strong>E – Exchange through faith and repentance.</strong> “Jesus rose again. Now God calls us to repent (turn from sin) and believe (trust) in Jesus as Savior and Lord. He will forgive and change you.”</li>
    <li><strong>D – Decision is personal.</strong> “You don’t need a scripted prayer. Talk to God from your heart. Surrender to Christ. If you’re ready, He hears you.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sample Script (Natural Style)</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “Bro, can I share something important? It changed my life.<br><br>
    God is holy. He created us to live for Him. But we’ve all sinned—we’ve lied, gotten angry, been selfish, and turned away from Him.<br><br>
    Because He is just, sin must be punished. That’s why hell is real.<br><br>
    But here’s the good news: Jesus came—He lived a perfect life, died on the cross to take our punishment, and rose again.<br><br>
    God now calls us to turn from sin and trust in Jesus. Not religion—but a real relationship.<br><br>
    He promises forgiveness, new life, and eternal life with Him.<br><br>
    If your heart is ready, talk to God—no need for fancy words. He hears you.”
