  <h1>The Gospel Message</h1>

  <p><strong>John MacArthur</strong>, a well-known pastor and Bible teacher, emphasizes a clear, biblical, and direct presentation of the gospel. While he doesn’t use a rigid step-by-step formula like some evangelistic programs, he has described his one-on-one evangelism approach as:</p>

  <h2>1. Starting with God's Holiness and the Law</h2>
  <p>MacArthur typically begins by establishing God’s holiness and the sinfulness of man, helping the person understand that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). He often uses the Ten Commandments to reveal personal guilt and the need for a Savior.</p>

  <h2>2. Presenting the Person and Work of Christ</h2>
  <p>He then shares who Jesus is—fully God and fully man—and what He accomplished:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lived a sinless life</li>
    <li>Died on the cross as a substitute for sinners</li>
    <li>Rose again on the third day</li>
  </ul>
  <p>He emphasizes penal substitution—that Christ bore the wrath of God in the sinner's place (Isaiah 53:5–6, 2 Corinthians 5:21).</p>

  <h2>3. Calling for Repentance and Faith</h2>
  <p>MacArthur stresses the biblical command to repent and believe (Mark 1:15). He doesn’t promote “easy-believism” or quick decisions; rather, he calls for genuine repentance, surrender to Christ’s lordship, and saving faith.</p>

  <h2>4. Avoiding Manipulation</h2>
  <p>He does not usually lead people in a sinner’s prayer. Instead, he encourages them to cry out to God from the heart. MacArthur believes salvation is a work of God, not something that comes through a scripted prayer or emotional pressure.</p>

  <h2>5. Pointing Them to Scripture and Ongoing Discipleship</h2>
  <p>He typically urges people to read the Bible (often starting in the Gospel of John or Romans), to seek truth, and to get connected with a sound, Bible-teaching church.</p>

  <h2>Simplified Version of MacArthur’s Gospel Sharing Approach</h2>
  <p>Start with God's Holiness:</p>
  <blockquote>“God is perfectly holy and just. He created us to know Him and live for Him.”</blockquote>
  <p>Explain Man’s Sinfulness:</p>
  <blockquote>“But every one of us has sinned—lied, lusted, been proud or angry—and broken His law.”</blockquote>
  <p>Describe the Consequence:</p>
  <blockquote>“Because God is just, sin must be punished. That’s eternal separation from Him—hell.”</blockquote>
  <p>Present Christ’s Saving Work:</p>
  <blockquote>“But God, in love, sent His Son, Jesus Christ—fully God and fully man—to live a perfect life and take the punishment we deserve by dying on the cross.”</blockquote>
  <p>Call for Repentance and Faith:</p>
  <blockquote>“He rose from the dead. And now, God commands all people to repent—turn from sin—and trust in Jesus alone to be forgiven and saved.”</blockquote>
  <p>Encourage a Heart Response:</p>
  <blockquote>“This isn’t about joining a religion or saying a prayer—it’s about surrendering your life to Jesus as Lord and Savior, believing in Him from your heart.”</blockquote>

  <h2>Narrative: Sharing the Gospel One-on-One</h2>
  <p><em>Setting: On a flight from Los Angeles to Dallas. He’s seated next to a businessman named Mike.</em></p>
  <p><strong>MacArthur:</strong> “Mike, can I ask you something? What do you think happens after we die?”</p>
  <p><strong>Mike:</strong> “Hmm. I think we just go to a better place… hopefully.”</p>
  <p><strong>MacArthur:</strong> “Most people hope that. But what if I told you God has actually told us what happens—and it’s more serious than most people think?”</p>

  <h2>Memorizable Outline (G.R.A.C.E.D.)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>G – God is holy.</strong> “God created us to know Him and live for Him. He is perfectly holy and just.”</li>
    <li><strong>R – Rebellion is our problem.</strong> “But we’ve all sinned—disobeyed God in thoughts, words, and actions.”</li>
    <li><strong>A – Accountability is real.</strong> “Because God is just, He will punish sin. The Bible says the wages of sin is death—eternal separation from Him.”</li>
    <li><strong>C – Christ is the solution.</strong> “God sent Jesus—fully God and fully man—to live a perfect life and die on the cross to take the punishment we deserve.”</li>
    <li><strong>E – Exchange through faith and repentance.</strong> “Jesus rose again. Now God calls us to repent (turn from sin) and believe (trust) in Jesus as Savior and Lord. He will forgive and change you.”</li>
    <li><strong>D – Decision is personal.</strong> “You don’t need a scripted prayer. Talk to God from your heart. Surrender to Christ. If you’re ready, He hears you.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sample Script (Natural Style)</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “Bro, can I share something important? It changed my life.<br><br>
    God is holy. He created us to live for Him. But we’ve all sinned—we’ve lied, gotten angry, been selfish, and turned away from Him.<br><br>
    Because He is just, sin must be punished. That’s why hell is real.<br><br>
    But here’s the good news: Jesus came—He lived a perfect life, died on the cross to take our punishment, and rose again.<br><br>
    God now calls us to turn from sin and trust in Jesus. Not religion—but a real relationship.<br><br>
    He promises forgiveness, new life, and eternal life with Him.<br><br>
    If your heart is ready, talk to God—no need for fancy words. He hears you.”
