  <div class="highlight">
    <p>Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?” (NASB 1995)</p>

    <h2>🔍 Inductive Study</h2>

    <h3>1. OBSERVATION – What does the text say?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Who is speaking?</strong> Jesus</li>
      <li><strong>To whom?</strong> Martha (sister of Lazarus)</li>
      <li><strong>When?</strong> After Lazarus had died and was buried for four days (John 11:17)</li>
      <li><strong>Where?</strong> Bethany, near Jerusalem</li>
      <li><strong>What is happening?</strong> Martha expresses faith in Jesus, and Jesus responds with a powerful statement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key Greek words and phrases:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"I am" (<em>Ego eimi</em>) – claim to divine identity</li>
      <li>"Resurrection" (<em>Anastasis</em>) – rising from the dead</li>
      <li>"Life" (<em>Zoe</em>) – eternal, spiritual life</li>
      <li>"Believes" (<em>Pisteuō</em>) – to trust, rely on</li>
      <li>"Will live even if he dies" – refers to future physical resurrection</li>
      <li>"Will never die" – eternal spiritual life</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>First half: Statement of truth – “I am the resurrection and the life...”</li>
      <li>Second half: Personal question – “Do you believe this?”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. INTERPRETATION – What does it mean?</h3>

    <h4>✝️ Theological Truths</h4>
    <h5>A. Jesus as the Source of Life and Resurrection</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Jesus doesn’t just give life—He <strong>is</strong> life and resurrection.</li>
      <li>He has power over physical death.</li>
      <li>He offers eternal spiritual life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>B. Two Types of Death and Life</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physical death:</strong> Believers will live again (future resurrection).</li>
      <li><strong>Spiritual death:</strong> Believers will never be separated from God.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>🧠 Commentary and Insights</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>This is the 5th “I AM” statement in the Gospel of John, connecting Jesus with Yahweh (Exodus 3:14).</li>
      <li>Jesus corrects Martha’s limited understanding of resurrection as only future.</li>
      <li>Greek: “Never die” is a double negative (<em>ou mē apothanē eis ton aiōna</em>) = eternal security.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      “The believer will experience physical death, but it is not the end — it is a doorway into eternal life. The soul lives on with Christ, and one day the body will rise. Jesus was telling Martha that He is the only source of both resurrection and life.”  
      <br>— John MacArthur
    </blockquote>

    <h4>🕰️ Historical and Literary Context</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Event timing:</strong> Just before Passion Week; the raising of Lazarus was Jesus’ last public miracle.</li>
      <li><strong>Why the delay?</strong> To glorify God and reveal Jesus as Messiah (John 11:4).</li>
      <li><strong>Authorship:</strong> Apostle John, writing from Ephesus around AD 85–95.</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> John 20:31 — “...so that you may believe...”</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h3>🙏 Simple Prayer</h3>
    <p>Lord Jesus, thank You for showing me that You are the resurrection and the life. You have power over death, and because of You, we have hope that goes beyond the grave. Help us to truly believe, not just in our minds but with our whole hearts. Teach us to live each day with the joy and courage that comes from knowing we will never be separated from You. Use us to share this hope with others who are afraid or grieving. We praise You, risen and living Lord. In Your name we pray, Amen.</p>
