    <h2 class="emoji">📖 Romans 3:23</h2>
    <blockquote>
      For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">🕵️ 1. Observation: What does the verse say?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">"For"</span> – connects to the verses before it, giving the reason or explanation.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"All"</span> –  includes every person, no exception.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"Have sinned"</span> – not “might sin” or “some sin,” but have sinned — a completed act.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"And"</span> – links sin with its result.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"Fall short"</span> – this is the ongoing effect of sin.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"Of the glory of God"</span> – God’s perfect standard, beauty, holiness, and righteousness.</li>
       </ul>
    <p>This is a universal truth about every human being.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">💡 2. Interpretation: What does it mean?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Jesus was perfectly sinless.</li>
      <li>Jesus was treated as if He were sin itself.</li>
      <li>This was done for us – for our benefit.</li>
      <li>We become the righteousness of God in Him.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This verse teaches substitution and our new identity in Christ.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">🧰 3. Application: How should I respond?</h3>
    <p>If you feel unworthy or guilty, remember this: Jesus took your sin and gave you His righteousness.</p>
    <p>God's love is already given through Jesus. You don’t need to earn it. Stop living in shame. You are accepted in Christ.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do I really believe that I am fully accepted by God in Christ?</li>
      <li>How can I live today in light of this “great exchange”?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">🙏 Short Prayer</h3>
    <p>
      Father, thank You for loving me so much that You sent Jesus to take my place. He took my sin so I could receive His righteousness. Help me to never forget this gift. Let me live each day knowing I am accepted, forgiven, and loved – not because of what I’ve done, but because of what Jesus did. In His name I pray, Amen.
