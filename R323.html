  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="emoji">📖 Romans 3:23 (NASB)</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">🕵️ 1. Observation: What does the verse say?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">"For"</span> – connects to the verses before it, giving the reason or explanation.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"All"</span> – includes every person, no exception.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"Have sinned"</span> – not “might sin” or “some sin,” but have sinned — a completed act.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"And"</span> – links sin with its result.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"Fall short"</span> – this is the ongoing effect of sin.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"Of the glory of God"</span> – God’s perfect standard, beauty, holiness, and righteousness.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a universal truth about every human being.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">💡 2. Interpretation: What does it mean?</h3>
    <p><strong>“For all have sinned…”</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every single person — young or old, rich or poor, religious or not — has sinned.</li>
      <li>Sin is not just doing something wrong. It is falling short of God's perfection in our thoughts, words, actions, and even desires.</li>
      <li>Sin is not just what we do — it’s part of who we are. We are born with a sinful nature.</li>
      <li>We sin because our hearts are not naturally drawn to God — they are drawn to selfishness, pride, and rebellion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This verse makes it clear: no one can claim to be good enough for God.</p>

    <p><strong>“…and fall short of the glory of God.”</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Fall short” means to miss the target, like an arrow that doesn't reach the mark.</li>
      <li>The “glory of God” is His perfect character, His holiness, and His standard for us.</li>
      <li>We were created to reflect God’s glory, but sin has damaged that reflection.</li>
      <li>No matter how hard we try, we cannot reach God’s standard by our own efforts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Imagine trying to jump across a wide canyon. Some may jump farther than others, but no one can cross. That’s how sin separates us from God.</p>

    <p><strong>Key truth:</strong></p>
    <p>This verse is part of a bigger message in Romans. It shows the bad news, so we understand why we need the good news of Jesus. If we don't see the seriousness of sin, we won't see the greatness of salvation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">🧰 3. Application: What does this mean for me?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Acknowledge that you are included in “all” — this verse speaks about you and me.</li>
      <li>Stop trusting in your own goodness or religion to be accepted by God — it will never be enough.</li>
      <li>Understand that you need a Savior, not just improvement.</li>
      <li>Be humble. No one is above this truth. Even the best people need forgiveness.</li>
      <li>Thank God that He didn’t leave us in our sin — the next verse (Romans 3:24) offers hope:</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      “being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.”
    </blockquote>
      <p>Without understanding our sin, we won’t appreciate God’s grace. This verse brings us low, so we can be lifted up by Jesus.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">🙏 Short Prayer</h3>
    <p>
      Father, I admit that I have sinned and fallen short of Your glory. I confess that I cannot reach You through my own efforts. Thank You for sending Jesus to save me. I receive Your grace and mercy today. Help me to walk in humility, always remembering what Jesus has done for me. In His name I pray, Amen.
    </p>
