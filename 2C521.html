    <blockquote>
      “He made Him who knew no sin to be sin in our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">🕵️ 1. Observation: What does the verse say?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">"He made Him"</span> – God the Father did something.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"Who knew no sin"</span> – Jesus, who was sinless.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"To be sin"</span> – Jesus took sin upon Himself.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"In our behalf"</span> – for our sake.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"So that we might become"</span> – we receive something.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"The righteousness of God"</span> – accepted before God.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">"In Him"</span> – possible only in Jesus.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a short but powerful summary of the Gospel.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">💡 2. Interpretation: What does it mean?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Jesus was perfectly sinless.</li>
      <li>Jesus was treated as if He were sin itself.</li>
      <li>This was done for us – for our benefit.</li>
      <li>We become the righteousness of God in Him.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This verse teaches substitution and our new identity in Christ.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">🧰 3. Application: How should I respond?</h3>
    <p>If you feel unworthy or guilty, remember this: Jesus took your sin and gave you His righteousness.</p>
    <p>God's love is already given through Jesus. You don’t need to earn it. Stop living in shame. You are accepted in Christ.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do I really believe that I am fully accepted by God in Christ?</li>
      <li>How can I live today in light of this “great exchange”?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3 class="emoji">🙏 Short Prayer</h3>
    <p>
      Father, thank You for loving me so much that You sent Jesus to take my place. He took my sin so I could receive His righteousness. Help me to never forget this gift. Let me live each day knowing I am accepted, forgiven, and loved – not because of what I’ve done, but because of what Jesus did. In His name I pray, Amen.
